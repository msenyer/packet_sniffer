# packet_sniffer
Simple sniffer implementation in C language on linux 
Making use of the libcap library
Based on different sources

Able to filter different protocols
User selects how many packets does he/she want to get
User selects which filter to apply

Further work needed, mostly on printing data from the different protocols and refining the filter
