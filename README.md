# packet_sniffer
Simple sniffer implementation in C language on linux , making use of the libcap library and based on different sources.

Able to filter different protocols.
User selects how many packets does he/she want to get.
User selects which filter to apply.

Further work needed, mostly on printing data from the different protocols, making it faster and refining the filter.
